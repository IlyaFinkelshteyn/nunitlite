TODO: Decide whether to make separate NUnitLite Project
or just have it as a series under NUnitFramework. 

Look at how other projects do this.

SEPARATE:
Set up NUnitLite project on LP and upload latest code
Merge 2.5 changes

COMBINED:
Make NUnitFramework project on LP and upload NUnitLite code
Merge in 2.5 changes
Add conditional compilation switches to build NUnitLite (and UltraLite?)
